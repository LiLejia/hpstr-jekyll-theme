If a-year-younger-me ask the now-me for advices, I will share some points with him.

- First of all, do all things proactively instead of reactively (This is what Zuckburg shared to F8ers in CEO weekly Q&A). When it comes to your career, what you have done is the only criteria of your own ability, at least it's the only thing you can show to your leader and your colleague your smartness and effort. Your mom or you spouse may know you are a great guy, but they do not. You should come out and do things to prove it.

However, one man can achieve few things during limited time. So you need a team. So you recruit a team. Recruit is actually quite not that hard because it's almost a linear complicity. The problem is what things each team member will do based on what exact common goal. That problem is called management. From now on, you should realize that normally what yourself can achieve anything proves little, what you lead a whole team achieve one big goal talks. From now on, you should not trying to organize your own time but also others'. You have to prove that everybody else are doing things proactively.

After all, I am still a young boy on management. It's all about goal, time and people.

- Sleep earlier and get up earlier. You can hardly get up at 7 am. while you slept at 2 am.

- Choose a good leader. A experienced leader is a mentor and advisor. Or it will really really suck, trust me.
